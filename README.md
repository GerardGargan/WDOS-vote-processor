# WDOS Voting form processor

This project was created to automate the processing of votes for a competition.
The votes were cast on a Microsoft forms submission. The excel of votes is downloaded and saves as a .csv file in the root project folder.

The program then processes the data and determines the number of points per site.

Included is the function to:
- Display a leaderboard
- Display top 5 winners/places
- Write results to a csv file
