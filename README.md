# WDOS Voting form processor

This project was created to automate the processing of votes for a competition.
The votes were cast on a Microsoft forms submission. The excel of votes is downloaded and saved as a .csv file in the root project folder.

The program then processes the data and determines the number of points per site.

Included is the functionality to:
- Display a leaderboard by site
- Display top 5 winners/places
- Write the results to a csv file

The program was particularly useful as the excel was not user friendly, and it took quite some time to work out the number of points per site. In addition, it was very easy to make a mistake.

As the competition was live, the senior management often would ask for an update on the leaderboard. This program made that very easy and quick to work out, compared to the manual error prone process.
